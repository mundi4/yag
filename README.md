This is a very basic and straightforward app. It was created specifically for my superior, who is nearly computer-illiterate, to be able to use it with ease (even the ‘Y’ in the app’s name is her initial). The UI is **intentionally** simplistic to the point of being unadorned. I developed this app using the Dart language and Flutter for the first time (for fun).
