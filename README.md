# what is this?
This app is straightforward, designed for a single, daily repetitive task. Created specifically for my superior, who is not tech-savvy, the UI is intentionally simple for ease of use. The ‘Y’ in the app’s name is a nod to her initial. Developed using Dart and Flutter for the first time.
